Given an array of size N containing positive integers n and a number k,The absolute difference between values at indices i and j is |a[i] â€“ a[j]|. There are n*(n-1)/2 such pairs and you have to print the kth smallest absolute difference among all these pairs.
 

Example 1:

Input : 
N = 4
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
k = 3
Output : 
1 
Explanation :
The possible absolute differences are :
{1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1}.
The 3rd smallest value among these is 1.
 
Example 2:
Input : 
N = 2
A[] = {10, 10}
k = 1
Output :
0

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function kthDiff() which takes the array A[], its size N and an integer k as inputs and returns the kth smallest absolute difference among all these pairs.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O( N. (Log(N))2 )
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Log(N))

 

Constraints:
1<=N<=105
1<=a[i]<=105
1 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2
